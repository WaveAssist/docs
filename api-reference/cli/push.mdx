# `waveassist push`

Push your local Python code to a WaveAssist project.

## Usage

waveassist push PROJECT_ID [--force]
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |

## Options

| Option | Description |

| `--force` | Skip confirmation before pushing |

## Description

The `push` command uploads your local Python code to the specified WaveAssist project. This command only pushes code files and does not affect project configuration or data.

By default, the command will ask for confirmation before pushing. Use the `--force` flag to skip this confirmation.

## Examples

```bash
# Push with confirmation
$ waveassist push my-project-id
Are you sure you want to push local code to project 'my-project-id'? [y/N]: y
✓ Successfully pushed code to project

# Push without confirmation
$ waveassist push my-project-id --force
✓ Successfully pushed code to project
```
