# WaveAssist API

WaveAssist provides a comprehensive REST API that enables you to programmatically manage your projects, nodes, data, and deployments. The API is organized around the following main categories:

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using your project key. You can obtain your project key from the [WaveAssist Dashboard](https://app.waveassist.io/manage/nodes).

## Core Features

### Project Management

- Create and manage projects via `/manage/create_project` and `/manage/fetch_all_projects`
- Handle project variables with `/manage/fetch_project_variables`
- Manage environments using `/manage/fetch_environments`

### Node Operations

- Create, update, and delete nodes using `/manage/create_node`, `/manage/update_node`, and `/manage/delete_node`
- Manage node configurations and code via `/manage/update_code`
- View node status with `/manage/fetch_nodes`

### Data Management

- Upload and download data files using `/data/upload_data_file` and `/data/download_data_file`
- Get and set data for specific keys via `/data/fetch_data_for_key` and `/data/set_data_for_key`
- Handle integration data with `/data/get_integration_data`

### Deployment & Debug

- Deploy and stop projects using `/deploy/deploy_project` and `/deploy/stop_deployment`
- Run DAGs and generate visualizations via `/deploy/run_dag` and `/deploy/generate_dag_image`
- Access logs and manage packages through `/debug/fetch_logs` and related endpoints

## Python SDK

For Python users, we recommend using our official Python package:

```bash
pip install waveassist
```

This provides a convenient interface to interact with WaveAssist's API and manage your AI assistant variables. Example usage:

```python
from waveassist import WaveAssist

# Initialize client with your project key
wa = WaveAssist(project_key='your_project_key')

# Get and set variables
value = wa.get('variable_name')
wa.set('variable_name', new_value)

# Deploy project
wa.deploy()

# Run a specific node
wa.run_node('node_key', parameters={})

# View logs
logs = wa.get_logs('node_key')
```
