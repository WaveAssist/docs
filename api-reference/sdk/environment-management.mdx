Learn how to work with different **environments** in your WaveAssist projects.

## Understanding Environments

Environments allow you to separate your data and workflows across different contexts (e.g., development, staging, production).

## Setting the Environment

```python
import waveassist

# Initialize with specific environment
waveassist.init(
    token="your-api-token",
    project_key="your-project-id",
    environment_key="production"
)

# Or switch environment later
waveassist.set_environment("staging")
```

## Environment-Specific Operations

```python
# Store data in specific environment
waveassist.store_data(
    "config",
    {"debug": True},
    environment="development"
)

# Fetch data from specific environment
prod_config = waveassist.fetch_data(
    "config",
    environment="production"
)
```

## Environment Functions

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| set_environment(key) | Switch to a different environment |
| get_current_environment() | Get the current environment key |
| list_environments() | List all available environments |

## Best Practices

1. Use consistent environment names
2. Keep production data separate
3. Use environment-specific configurations
4. Handle environment switching carefully

## Example: Environment Management

```python
import waveassist

# Initialize with default environment
waveassist.init(token="token", project_key="project")

# List all environments
environments = waveassist.list_environments()

# Work with different environments
for env in ["development", "staging", "production"]:
    waveassist.set_environment(env)
    config = waveassist.fetch_data("config")
    print(f"{env} config:", config)
```
