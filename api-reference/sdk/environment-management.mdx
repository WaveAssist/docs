Learn how to work with different **environments** in your WaveAssist projects.

## Understanding Environments

Environments allow you to separate your data and workflows across different contexts (e.g., development, staging, production).

## Setting the Environment

```python
import waveassist

# Initialize with specific environment
waveassist.init(
    token="your-api-token",
    project_key="your-project-id",
    environment_key="production"
)
```

## Environment defaults

If no environment is specified, the SDK will default to the environment configured as the default in your project settings or the environment the code is running on.
