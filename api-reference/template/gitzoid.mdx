## Overview

GitZoid is an **open-source** GitHub bot that automates pull-request reviews and comments using AI models (OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini or Anthropic's Claude 3.5). By default, it's designed to run on the [WaveAssist](https://waveassist.io) platform—which handles node orchestration, scheduling, secrets/variable storage, and hosting—but you can also run it as a standalone Python application.

You can try out the **hosted version** of GitZoid at [https://gitzoid.com](https://gitzoid.com) — no setup required.

## Features

  Seed your list of repositories into WaveAssist or a local store.

* **AI-Powered Code Reviews**
  Uses OpenAI or Anthropic to generate structured feedback.
