The **Variables** section in WaveAssist allows you to manage key-value pairs and view workflow data directly from your dashboard. You can create, update, delete variables, and inspect associated data with ease.

## Managing Variables

Variables are reusable key-value pairs used across nodes and workflows. These values can be dynamically updated during execution or manually configured.

### Key Features
- **Create Variables**: Add new variables with a unique key and select a data type.
- **Edit Variables**: Modify the value or type of an existing variable.
- **Delete Variables**: Remove variables that are no longer in use.

### Supported Data Types

#### `string`
Use the `string` data type to store plain text or simple values.
Example:
```plaintext
"This is a string value"
```

#### `json`
Structured data such as objects or arrays.
```json
{
  "key": "value",
  "list": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

#### `dataframe`
Use the `dataframe` data type to store tabular data in CSV format.
Supports structured data with rows and columns.
Example:
```csv
id,name,value
1,item1,100
2,item2,200
3,item3,300
  ```

## Viewing and Managing Variables

The **Data Viewer** allows you to inspect and manage the data used in your workflows. You can filter, view, and export data directly from the dashboard.

### Key Features
- **View Data**: Inspect the data stored in your project.
- **Filter Data**: Apply filters to narrow down the data you want to view.
- **Export Data**: Download data for external use.

## Managing DataFrames

For more complex data structures like DataFrames, we recommend using the WaveAssist Python SDK. The SDK provides a convenient interface to fetch, manipulate, and store DataFrames.


By combining the dashboard and the Python SDK, you can efficiently manage all your data needs in WaveAssist.
