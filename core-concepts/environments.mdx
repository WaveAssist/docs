# Environment Management

WaveAssist supports multiple environments to help you build, test, and run your workflows in isolated, context-specific setups.

Environments let you:
- Reuse the same **project code, nodes, and structure**
- Swap out **credentials, API keys, or user-specific settings**
- Separate **development**, **staging**, and **production** configurations

## Common Environment Types

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Development" icon="code">
    For experimenting and debugging workflows
  </Card>
  <Card title="Staging" icon="flask">
    For testing workflows before going live
  </Card>
  <Card title="Production" icon="rocket">
    For executing workflows in real-world use
  </Card>
  <Card title="Custom" icon="gear">
    For client-specific or account-based contexts

## Real-World Example

Imagine you have a project that uses OpenAI to generate content. You want:

- In **Dev**, to use a test OpenAI key under your account
- In **Prod**, to use a client’s OpenAI key under a different account

You don’t want to modify your project code or node logic — just swap the environment.

---

## How It Works

Each environment in WaveAssist:
- Shares the **same project code and nodes**
- Has its own set of **environment variables** (like `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`, etc.)
- Can be selected when running workflows manually or via triggers

---

## Using Environments in Code

```python
from waveassist import WAHelper

# Initialize with environment
helper = WAHelper(
    project_key='your-project-key',
    environment='production'  # or 'development', 'staging', etc.
)

# Fetch API key based on current environment
openai_key = helper.fetch_data("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

This lets you deploy the same codebase in multiple contexts without changing a single line of logic.

---

## Variable Management

To assign environment-specific values:

1. Go to the **Variables** tab
2. Add a variable (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
3. Assign different values for each environment (Dev, Staging, Prod)

---

## Best Practices

- Keep variable names consistent across environments
- Avoid hardcoding secrets in your nodes
- Use environment-specific logging if needed (e.g., log to different files)

---

WaveAssist environments make it easy to scale your workflows from solo dev testing to enterprise-ready automation — securely and safely.
