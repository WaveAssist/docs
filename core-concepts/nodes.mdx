**Nodes** are the building blocks of your AI assistants in WaveAssist. You can create, update, and manage nodes directly from the dashboard. Each node can be scheduled to run at specific intervals or triggered manually.

## Key Features

- **Create Nodes**: Add new nodes to your AI assistant.
- **Edit Nodes**: Modify existing nodes.
- **Delete Nodes**: Remove nodes that are no longer needed.
- **View Code**: Inspect the code associated with a node.
- **Enable/Disable Nodes**: Toggle the status of a node to enable or disable its execution.

## Enabling and Disabling Nodes

Each node can be enabled or disabled based on your AI assistant requirements:

- **Enabled**: The node is active and will execute based on its schedule or when triggered manually.
- **Disabled**: The node is inactive and will not execute, even if triggered manually or scheduled.

You can toggle the status of a node using the **Status** dropdown in the node editor.

## Starting Node

The **Starting Node** option allows you to designate a node as the entry point for your AI assistant. When an AI assistant is triggered, execution begins from the starting node and proceeds through the defined sequence of nodes.

- Only one node can be marked as the starting node in an AI assistant.
- If no starting node is defined, the AI assistant will not execute automatically.

## Scheduling Nodes

Nodes can be scheduled to run at specific intervals or based on a cron expression. WaveAssist supports two scheduling types:

### Interval Scheduling

- Run the node at fixed intervals, such as every 12 hours or every 2 days.
- This is useful for periodic tasks that need to execute regularly.

### Cron Job Scheduling

- Use cron expressions to define complex schedules with precision.
- Cron jobs allow you to specify the exact minute, hour, day, month, and day of the week for execution.

#### Example Cron Expression

The following example runs the node at 9:35 AM, 11:35 AM, and 1:35 PM on weekdays (Monday to Friday) in the `Asia/Kolkata` timezone:

```
Minute: 35
Hour: 9,11,13
Day of Month: *
Month of Year: *
Day of Week: 1-5
Timezone: Asia/Kolkata
```

### How to Configure Scheduling

1. Open the **Edit Node** dialog.
2. Select the **Schedule Type**:
   - Choose **Interval** for fixed intervals.
   - Choose **Cron** for custom schedules.
3. If using **Cron**, fill in the fields for minute, hour, day, month, and day of the week.
4. Select the appropriate timezone.
5. Save your changes.

By combining scheduling options with the ability to enable/disable nodes, you can create highly flexible and efficient AI assistants in WaveAssist.
