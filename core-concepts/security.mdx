## Project Keys

Project keys are essential for secure access to WaveAssist:

```python
from waveassist import WAHelper

# Secure initialization
helper = WAHelper(
    project_key='your-project-key',
    encryption_enabled=True
)

# Rotate project keys
helper.rotate_project_key()

# Check key permissions
permissions = helper.get_key_permissions()
```

## Access Management

```python
# Set up role-based access
helper.set_role_permissions({
    'data_scientist': [
        'read_data',
        'write_data',
        'execute_nodes'
    ],
    'admin': [
        'manage_keys',
        'manage_roles',
        'manage_environments'
    ]
})

# Grant access
helper.grant_access('user@example.com', 'data_scientist')
```
