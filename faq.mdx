## General Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="question" title="What is WaveAssist?">
    WaveAssist is a powerful platform for creating and managing Python-based workflows. It allows you to:
    - Automate tasks using nodes
    - Manage data securely with dedicated MongoDB databases
    - Schedule workflows with triggers or cron jobs
    - Deploy and monitor workflows in live environments
    - Integrate with APIs, AI models, and external tools
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="key" title="How do I get my project key?">
    1. Log in to the [WaveAssist Dashboard](https://app.waveassist.io).
    2. Select your project.
    3. Go to **Project Settings**.
    4. Find your project key in the **API Keys** section.
    
    **Important**: Keep your project key secure and never share it publicly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="code" title="Can I develop locally without using the dashboard?">
    Yes! WaveAssist provides a Python SDK that allows you to:
    - Develop and test nodes locally
    - Access project variables
    - Manage data and workflows

## Nodes and Workflows

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="diagram-project" title="What are nodes in WaveAssist?">
    Nodes are the building blocks of your workflows. Each node:
    - Performs a specific task (e.g., data processing, API integration)
    - Can process inputs and generate outputs
    - Can be scheduled to run automatically or triggered manually
    - Can be connected to other nodes to create complex workflows
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="clock" title="How do I schedule node execution?">
    WaveAssist provides multiple scheduling options:
    - Fixed intervals (e.g., every 12 hours)
    - Cron expressions for custom schedules
    - Event-based triggers
    - Manual execution
    
    You can set schedules either through the dashboard or using the Python SDK.
  </Accordion>

  

  <Accordion icon="play" title="How do I run a workflow?">
    To run a workflow:
    1. Ensure your nodes are connected using the **Starting Node** and **Run After Nodes** options.
    2. Press the **Play** button on the **Starting Node** from the project dashboard.
    3. Monitor the execution in the **Logs** section.
  </Accordion>

## Data Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="database" title="How does data handling work?">
    WaveAssist provides several ways to handle data:
    - Upload files directly through the dashboard.
    - Use the Python SDK for programmatic data access.
    - Connect to external data sources like APIs or databases.
    - Store and retrieve data using data keys in the **Data** tab.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="lock" title="How does WaveAssist ensure my data is secure?">
    Yes, WaveAssist ensures your data is secure through the following measures:
    - **Encrypted Data Transmission**: All data transmitted between your browser, the WaveAssist platform, and external integrations is encrypted using industry-standard protocols.
    - **Dedicated MongoDB Database**: Each user is allocated a dedicated MongoDB database to ensure complete data isolation and protection.
    - **Secure Project Isolation**: Projects are securely isolated to prevent unauthorized access or interference between different workflows.
    - **Access Control with Project Keys**: Each project is protected with unique project keys, ensuring only authorized users can access or modify project data.
    - **Environment-Specific Configurations**: Data is managed securely across different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) with strict access controls.
    
    These measures ensure that your data remains private, secure, and accessible only to you and your authorized team members.
  </Accordion>
