## Nodes and Workflows

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="diagram-project" title="What are nodes in WaveAssist?">
    Nodes are the building blocks of your workflows. Each node:
    - Performs a specific task
    - Can process inputs and generate outputs
    - Can be scheduled to run automatically
    - Can be connected to other nodes to create complex workflows
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="clock" title="How do I schedule node execution?">
    WaveAssist provides multiple scheduling options:
    - Fixed intervals (e.g., every 12 hours)
    - Cron expressions for custom schedules
    - Event-based triggers
    - Manual execution
    
    You can set schedules either through the dashboard or using the Python SDK.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="gear" title="What types of nodes can I create?">
    WaveAssist supports various node types:
    - Data processing nodes
    - API integration nodes
    - Machine learning nodes
    - Custom nodes with your own logic
    
    Each type can be customized with specific inputs, outputs, and configurations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="bug" title="Common node execution errors">
    Common issues and solutions:
    1. **Connection errors**
       - Verify your project key
       - Check network connectivity
       - Ensure SDK is up to date
    
    2. **Runtime errors**
       - Check node dependencies
       - Verify input data format
       - Review node logs
    
    3. **Scheduling issues**
       - Confirm timezone settings
       - Check node status
       - Verify cron expressions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="rotate" title="How do I update my nodes?">
    To update existing nodes:
    1. In the dashboard:

       ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="star" title="Tips for efficient workflow design">
    1. **Keep nodes focused**
