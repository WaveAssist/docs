## Nodes and AI Assistants

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="diagram-project" title="What are nodes in WaveAssist?">
    Nodes are the building blocks of your AI assistants. Each node:
    - Performs a specific task (e.g., data processing, API integration)
    - Can process inputs and generate outputs
    - Can be scheduled to run automatically or triggered manually
    - Can be connected to other nodes to create complex AI assistants
  </Accordion>

{" "}
<Accordion icon="clock" title="How do I schedule node execution?">
	WaveAssist provides multiple scheduling options: - Fixed intervals (e.g., every 12 hours) - Cron expressions for custom schedules - Event-based
	triggers - Manual execution You can set schedules either through the dashboard or using the Python SDK.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="play" title="How do I run an AI assistant?">
    To run an AI assistant:
    1. Ensure your nodes are connected using the **Starting Node** and **Run After Nodes** options.
    2. Press the **Play** button on the **Starting Node** from the project dashboard.
    3. Monitor the execution in the **Logs** section.
  </Accordion>

## Data Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="database" title="How does data handling work?">
    WaveAssist provides several ways to handle data:
    - Upload files directly through the dashboard.
    - Use the Python SDK for programmatic data access.
    - Connect to external data sources like APIs or databases.
    - Store and retrieve data using data keys in the **Data** tab.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="lock" title="How does WaveAssist ensure my data is secure?">
    Yes, WaveAssist ensures your data is secure through the following measures:
    - **Encrypted Data Transmission**: All data transmitted between your browser, the WaveAssist platform, and external integrations is encrypted using industry-standard protocols.
    - **Dedicated MongoDB Database**: Each user is allocated a dedicated MongoDB database to ensure complete data isolation and protection.
    - **Secure Project Isolation**: Projects are securely isolated to prevent unauthorized access or interference between different AI assistants.
    - **Access Control with Project Keys**: Each project is protected with unique project keys, ensuring only authorized users can access or modify project data.
    - **Environment-Specific Configurations**: Data is managed securely across different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) with strict access controls.
    
    These measures ensure that your data remains private, secure, and accessible only to you and your authorized team members.
