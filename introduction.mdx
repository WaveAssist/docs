# Welcome to WaveAssist

WaveAssist is a powerful platform that helps you create, manage, and automate AI workflows. This guide will help you get started with creating your first project and understanding the dashboard.

## Dashboard Overview

The WaveAssist dashboard is organized into several key sections:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Nodes" icon="diagram-project">
    Create and manage your workflow nodes
  </Card>
  <Card title="Variables" icon="code">
    Manage project variables and configurations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Packages" icon="box">
    Install and manage Python packages
  </Card>
  <Card title="Environments" icon="server">
    Configure different deployment environments
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Creating Your First Project

1. Log in to the [WaveAssist Dashboard](https://app.waveassist.io)
2. Click the "Add Project" card to create a new project
3. Fill in your project details
4. Navigate to the Nodes section to start building your workflow

<Frame caption="Create new project">
  <img
    className="rounded-lg shadow-lg dark:shadow-neutral-900"
    src="/images/create_project.png"
    alt="WaveAssist Project Creation"
  />
</Frame>

### Project Details
When creating a new project, you'll need to provide:
- Project name (e.g., "FirstProject", "WaveAssist")
- Project key (e.g., "fp", "wa")
- Description (optional)

<Frame caption="Project details configuration">
  <img
    className="rounded-lg shadow-lg dark:shadow-neutral-900 border border-neutral-200 dark:border-neutral-700"
    src="/images/project_details.png"
    alt="Project Details Configuration"
  />
</Frame>

Once created, your project will appear in the dashboard alongside other projects, where you can easily access and manage it.

## Managing Nodes

In the Nodes section, you can:

### Create a Node
Click the '+' button in the top-right corner to create a new node. Each node represents a specific task in your workflow.

### Configure Node Settings
For each node, you can configure:
- **Name**: A unique identifier for your node
- **Status**: Enable/disable the node
- **Schedule**: Set intervals for automatic execution
  - Options include:
    - Every 12 hours
    - Every 12 days
    - Cron expressions for custom schedules

### Node Actions
Each node has three main actions:
- **View Code**: Edit the node's implementation
- **Edit**: Modify node configuration
- **Run**: Execute the node manually

## Example Node Types

Here are some common node types you can create:
