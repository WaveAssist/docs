## Benefits for Developers and Teams

WaveAssist is built for modern builders who want to automate workflows without worrying about infrastructure.

### For Developers:
- Write simple Python functions as modular nodes
- Easily connect logic in sequence or parallel
- Test and debug directly from the dashboard
- Scale up with variables, triggers, and environments

### For Teams:
- Collaborate in shared projects
- Monitor runs, logs, and results in real-time
- Keep logic version-controlled and modular
- Integrate with APIs, CRON jobs, webhooks, or LLMs

Whether you're a solo hacker or an engineering team — WaveAssist adapts to your style of building.
