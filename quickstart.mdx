## Build Your First Workflow: Fortune of the Day

Letâ€™s build a simple, fun workflow that shows how WaveAssist works â€” no setup, no APIs, just Python logic.

**Goal**: Generate a daily fortune and log it.

---

### Step 1: Create a Project

1. Log in to [WaveAssist Dashboard](https://app.waveassist.io)
2. Click **Add Project**
3. Name it something like `daily-fortune`

### Step 2: Add a Node to Choose a Fortune

Create a Python node named `choose_fortune.py` with the following code:

```python
import random

def run():
    fortunes = [
        "Today is your lucky day!",
        "Curiosity leads to breakthroughs.",
        "Take a deep breath and smile.",
        "Be bold. Fortune favors the brave!"
    ]
    return random.choice(fortunes)
```

---

### Step 3: Add a Node to Log It

Now create a second node called `log_fortune.py`:

```python
def run(inputs):
    print("ðŸ§¿ Your fortune:", inputs)
```

---

### Step 4: Connect the Nodes

1. Open the Workflow builder
2. Connect `choose_fortune` â†’ `log_fortune`
