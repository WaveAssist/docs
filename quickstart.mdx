## Step 2: Add a Node to Choose a Fortune

Nodes are Python scripts that represent tasks in your workflow. Letâ€™s create a node to randomly select a fortune.

1. Open your project and click **Add Node**.
2. Fill in the node details:
   - **Node Name**: `Choose Fortune`
   - **Enabled**: 'Enabled'
   - **Starting Node**: Check this box to make it the starting node of the workflow.
   - **Interval**: Cron to run it every morning at 8:30 am of your timezone.

</Frame>

3. Click Save, and then click on `View Code`.

4. Paste the following code into the editor: _Dont forget to replace your uid in the code - download by clicking on Download Keys_

```python
# Import the WaveAssist SDK to interact with your project
import waveassist

# Initialize the WaveAssist client with your unique project UID and name
# Replace <your-uid-here> with your actual UID
waveassist.init('<your-uid-here>', 'daily-fortune')

# Define a list of fortune messages to be stored
fortunes = [
    "Today is your lucky day!",
    "Curiosity leads to breakthroughs.",
    "Take a deep breath and smile.",
    "Be bold. Fortune favors the brave!",
    "Patience is a virtue.",
    "Every day is a fresh start."
]

# Store the list of fortunes in WaveAssistâ€™s data storage under the key 'fortunes'
waveassist.store_data('fortunes', fortunes)

# Print confirmation with the stored fortunes
print("Stored Fortunes:", fortunes)
```

---

## Step 3: Add another Node to Log the Fortune

Now, letâ€™s create another node to log the fortune.

1. Click **Add Node** again.
2. Fill in the node details:
   - **Node Name**: `Log Fortune`
   - **Enabled**: 'Enabled'
   - **Run After Nodes**: Select `Choose Fortune` from the list to ensure this node runs after the `Choose Fortune` node.
     <Frame caption="Log Fortune Node">
     	<img src="/images/log_fortune_node.png" alt="Log Fortune Node" />
     </Frame>
3. Click Save, and then click on `View Code`. Paste the following code into the editor:

```python
import waveassist
import random

# Initialize the WaveAssist client using your project UID and name
# Replace <your-uid-here> with your actual UID
waveassist.init('<your-uid-here>', 'daily-fortune')

# Fetch the list of stored fortunes from WaveAssist's data storage
fortunes = waveassist.fetch_data('fortunes')

# Select a random fortune for today
today_fortune = random.choice(fortunes)

# Display the selected fortune
print("Your fortune for today:", today_fortune)

# Save for future work
waveassist.store_data('today_fortune',today_fortune)
```

4. Click **Save**.

## Step 4: Run the Workflow
