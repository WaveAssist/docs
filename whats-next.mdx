# Next Steps: Expand Your Fortune of the Day Project

You've built your first working workflow â€” congrats! ðŸŽ‰  
Now letâ€™s explore how you can grow it into a full automation system.

---

## 1. Send Your Fortune via Email

Add a new node `Send Email`:

1. Click **Add Node** in your project dashboard.
2. Fill in the node details:
   - **Node Name**: `Send Email`
   - **Run After Nodes**: Select `Log Fortune` to ensure this node runs after the fortune is logged.
3. Paste the following code into the editor:

```python
import smtplib
from email.message import EmailMessage
import waveassist

# Replace <your-uid-here> with your actual UID
waveassist.init('<your-uid-here>', 'daily-fortune')

# Fetch email credentials from the Data tab
# Note: If using Gmail, you may need to enable "App Passwords" or allow less secure apps.
# For more information, visit: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833
email_user = 'your_email@gmail.com'
email_password = 'your_password'
recipient_email = 'recipient_email@gmail.com'

# Fetch the stored fortune from the Data tab
today_fortune = waveassist.fetch_data('today_fortune')

# Create the email message
msg = EmailMessage()
msg.set_content(f"Your Fortune: {today_fortune}")
msg["Subject"] = "Your Daily Fortune"
msg["From"] = email_user
msg["To"] = recipient_email

# Send the email
with smtplib.SMTP("smtp.gmail.com", 587) as server:
    server.starttls()
    server.login(email_user, email_password)
    server.send_message(msg)

print("Email sent successfully!")
```

4. Store your email credentials as variables in the **Data** section of the dashboard.
5. Click **Save**.

## 2. Run and Re-Deploy

1. Run your workflow by clickin on the play button of the first node and verify that you received the email successfully.
2. Once confirmed, click **Deploy** to publish your updated workflow with version `0.0.2`.

That's it! You will now receive daily emails about your fortune from WaveAssist! ðŸŽ‰
