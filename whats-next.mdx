# What‚Äôs Next: Expand Your Fortune of the Day Project

You've built your first working workflow ‚Äî congrats! üéâ  
Now let‚Äôs explore how you can grow it into a full automation system.

---

## 1. Send Your Fortune via Email

Add a new node `send_email.py`:

```python
import smtplib
from email.message import EmailMessage

def run(inputs):
    msg = EmailMessage()
    msg.set_content(f"Your Fortune: {inputs}")
    msg["Subject"] = "Your Daily Fortune"
    msg["From"] = "you@example.com"
    msg["To"] = "your@email.com"

    with smtplib.SMTP("smtp.gmail.com", 587) as server:
        server.starttls()
        server.login("you@example.com", "your-password")
        server.send_message(msg)
```

Store credentials as variables in the dashboard.

---

## 2. Use AI to Generate Fortunes

Replace the static list with an OpenAI-generated response:

```python
import openai

def run():
    openai.api_key = "your-api-key"
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Give me a short daily fortune"}]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
```

---

## 3. Save Fortunes to History

Create a `save_to_file.py` node:

```python
def run(inputs):
    with open("/data/fortune_history.txt", "a") as f:
        f.write(inputs + "\n")
```

Use this to build a log of all your daily messages.

---

## 4. Automate with a Trigger

Use a **Scheduler Trigger** to run the workflow daily at 9 AM.

- Go to the **Triggers** tab
- Choose **Schedule**
- Set the time and link to your workflow

---

## 5. Add Conditional Logic

Introduce branching based on content:

- If the fortune includes ‚Äúlucky‚Äù, post to Slack
- Otherwise, just email it

This introduces **parallel paths** in your workflow ‚Äî making it dynamic and smarter.

---

## Keep Building

From this foundation, you can build:
- A Slack bot
- A fortune-sharing web page
- An SMS notifier
- A team-specific morale booster
