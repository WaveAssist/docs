# Next Steps: Expand Your Fortune of the Day Project

You've built your first working workflow â€” congrats! ðŸŽ‰  
Now letâ€™s explore how you can grow it into a full automation system.

## 1. Send Your Fortune via Email

Add a new node `Send Email`:

1. Click **Add Node** in your project dashboard.
2. Fill in the node details:
   - **Node Name**: `Send Email`
   - **Run After Nodes**: Select `Log Fortune` to ensure this node runs after the fortune is logged.
3. Paste the following code into the editor:

```python
import waveassist

# Initialize WaveAssist with your credentials
waveassist.init('<your-uid-here>', 'daily-fortune')

# Fetch the stored fortune from the Data tab
today_fortune = waveassist.fetch_data('today_fortune')

# Send the fortune via email
waveassist.send_mail(
    subject="Your Daily Fortune",
    html_content=f"<p>Your Fortune: {today_fortune}</p>"
)

print("Email sent successfully!")
```

4. Make sure you have configured your email settings in the WaveAssist dashboard.
5. Click **Save**.

## 2. Run and Re-Deploy
